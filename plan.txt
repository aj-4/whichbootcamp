Hypothesis:
- There is already a big site for bootcampers (Switchup) but the reviews seem skewed / wrong. People will also want to consult multiple resources and articles before making such a big decision so there is a lot of space in the market

MVP:
- Similar to nomad list, just provide information in a super clean UI - there will be icons for which programming languages are used as well as trending popularity. There will also be links to other articles around the web (switchup, top answers on quota, etc.

Built w/ React and Firebase

Additional Features:
X First there will be email validation to leave a review, if people don't check the box, 'did you attend this bootcamp' their review will still be accepted but ultimately ignored.  Keeps out noise

- The review flow will be answering questions (would you attend this bootcamp again? were the instructors experienced and passionate? What is your future outlook for this bootcamp? How was the career coaching? Was it worth what you paid?)

- Bootcamp news pulled in from across the web (Google RSS API from NPM ? )

- Trending searches / clicks for each bootcamp / web sentiment analysis / google trends API
